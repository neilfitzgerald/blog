Hi, I'm Neil. I work at [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/). I spend most of my time writing software or tools to help test other software.

I'm not a great writer. I tend to have poor transitions and leave things out. I use too many big words and long sentences. I'm working on it.

I've worked in the software industry for over 20 years. I've been around the block a bit. During that time I've had enough experiences with testing, software quality, and management to develop some thoughts on these topics. I plan to focus this blog mostly on these topics.

I'm constantly having to learn new technologies, and will likely will include some stuff on that too.

I'm into photography, kayaking and travel, go see my G+ for more of that. I took the picture that is used as the background on the about page.
